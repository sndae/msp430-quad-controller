The controller is at first directed at using the [MSP430G2553](http://www.ti.com/product/msp430g2553) (shipped with the [launchpad](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/MSP430_LaunchPad_(MSP-EXP430G2)) for only [4.3$](https://estore.ti.com/MSP-EXP430G2-MSP430-LaunchPad-Value-Line-Development-kit-P2031.aspx)) to control a simple quadcopter.

_No remote control will be supported initially._

A [Wii motion plus](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/premium-motionplus-for-wii-remote-white-32506) gyro will be used to keep the quad stable.

Some code are inspired from simple-flight-controller.

Future plans include:
  * Making the controller more universal (making it a framework to use with different hardware etc)
  * Interfacing a Raspberry PI. It is planned that the code running on the Raspberry also will be part of the project.
  * Using the PI to connect to Smartphones, cameras, GPS etc.
